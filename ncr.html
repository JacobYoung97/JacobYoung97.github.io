                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

                    <p>My name is Jacob Young. I am a fourth year Computer Science Student (during this placement) with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Guelph. This page will document my 8 month work term (January - August, 2019) at NCR in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is my goal to explain the numerous ways that this work term has made me grow as both a Computer Science student and as a future employee in the workforce after graduation.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Employer Information</h2>

                    <p>
                        NCR is an American company founded in 1884 as National Cash Register. They focus in the area of financial transactions with Point of Sale (POS) systems, cheque imaging, and bank deposit software. They offer many different financial solutions for different industries; such as banking, restaurants, retail, and travel to name a few of them.
                        Their <a href="https://www.ncr.com/company/locations/north-america">offices</a> are located all over the world; including (but not limited to) the United States, Canada (in Mississauga, Quebec, and Waterloo), France, South Africa, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. One of the slogans of the company is "Turning Everyday Transactions into Meaningful Interactions" and "We turn everyday transactions into meaningful relationships."
                    </p>

                        This is an old NCR cash register. It demonstrates how far technology has come since the fouding of the company in the late 19th century.
                    </span>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>

                    <p>
                        During my 8 months at NCR, I was an engineering intern performing DevOps for the 
                        <a href="https://www.ncr.com/content/dam/ncrcom/content-type/brochures/NCR_TxInfinity_Omni_channel_Transaction_Processing_Brochure_US%20English.pdf">TxInfinity</a>
                        application. My overall role and purpose was to help to improve the application's release time, and implement/improve best practices while developing the application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some other tasks I did while at NCR to help improve TxInfinity include: <br>
                            -<br>
                            -<br>
                            -<br>
                            -<br>

                        Improving the existing application taught me a lot about how to handle production for large scale corporate applications. It taught me how to try and think of everything, including the little things to enhance the code in fewer commits and a faster turn around time.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>

                    <p>
                        While at NCR, my goals were: improve upon my oral communcation skills like in all my workterms, increase my Docker knowledge and learn Kubernetes effectively, advance my teamwork skills in a professional setting, better my ability to notice redundant code and reduce the repetition, and boost my written communcation skills when messaging team members. The tasks I was assigned were very helpful in meeting all of my goals. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Reflecting on all of my goals, I was extremely successful in the majority of them. For learning Docker and Kubernetes, I was able to effectively learn how Dockerfiles work to create the images used at NCR and how Kubernetes is able to deploy them to the various machines at the company. This is great knowledge as Docker and Kubernetes is used a lot in the computing industry. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>

                    <p>
                        NCR was a great company to work for in my final two co-op workterms of my undergraduate degree. Working at NCR helped improve my skillset by giving me experience in yet another field I could apply my degree towards (financial transactions), and demonstrating to future employers that I can take on any task with new technologies and implement them extremely effectively.

                    <p>
                        I also feel I have improved upon my ability to be a better team member within my team and the other teams. I was able to talk about my ideas and get an understanding of what I was going to be doing while talking to the supervisor and others about how they imagined the work would get done. Futhermore, I was also contacted by several members of the team asking questions about items I implemented in my 8 months.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgments</h2>

                    <p>I would like to thank everyone that I worked with on the many teams at NCR working on TxInfinity. The people I wokred closely with on Alpha Team, and the members of the other teams (pi, falcon, draft, delta, omega, and zeta), were all great coworkers. Everyone was great to work with and they really helped me to improve my skills on communicating between multiple teams in a single organization.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank computing co-op advisors Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts for their continued support with the computing program, with helping students work through the co-op application process, going to visit many students for the site visits, and helping with any other issues that the co-op students may have had this work term. I appreciate their commitments to the computing co-operative education program's ongoing success.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank academic advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read this work report. I appreciate the amount of time it takes to read every co-op student's report.</p>
